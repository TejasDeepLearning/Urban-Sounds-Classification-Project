# Urban-Sounds-Classification-Project

This is a repository that contains the files we will use to classify different urban sounds, mainly in cities and the like. We will create a model that can recognize different WAV files and distinguish them according to their classes.

We get the data ready for training in the 'EDA and Preprocessing' file, and start evaluating the model and testing it out in the 'Training and Testing' file. 


## What to install
[Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs), [The Urban Sounds Classification Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/urbansound8k-1)

## How to run the project
I followed this youtube tutorial to run the project [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHPpCXqQd7Y). The steps taken in these series of videos took me through the data preprocessing and model creation phases.
