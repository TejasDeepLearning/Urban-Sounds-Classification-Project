# Urban-Sounds-Classification-Project

This is a repository that contains the files we will use to classify different urban sounds, mainly in cities and the like. We will create a model that can recognize different WAV files and distinguish them according to their classes.

We get the data ready for training in the 'EDA and Preprocessing' file, and start evaluating the model and testing it out in the 'Training and Testing' file.
